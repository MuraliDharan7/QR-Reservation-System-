About:
The Train QR System project introduces an innovative solution to streamline the train reservation process. Utilizing QR codes, passengers can effortlessly reserve seats by scanning codes generated by the Railway Reservation System. The existing problems of inefficient reservation processes and potential conflicts over seat occupancy are addressed through this system. By implementing QR technology, the project enhances the user experience by simplifying the reservation process, reducing errors, and providing real-time occupancy data. The solution aims to create a smoother, more efficient, and user-friendly railway travel experience by leveraging the simplicity and effectiveness of QR codes in seat reservation and occupancy management.
